//Import ArrayList, HashSet, Iterator, LinkedHashSet, List and TreeSet packages

//Create a public class named StudentBranch

	
	//Create a String variable named branch
	

	//Create a List variable named studentList1 with String as Generics
	
	//Create a HashSet variable named hs with the same String as Generics
	
	//Create a LinkedHashSet variable named lhs with the same String as Generics

	//Create a TreeSet variable named ts with String as Generics

	//Include appropriate getters and setters

	
	//Create a method named HashSet with a List variable as its parameter and Object as its return type

		//Using an iterator add the values into the hash set
		
		//return the hash set 

	//Repeat the same procedure for LinkedHashSet and TreeSet

	
	//On clicking the add button, the values are to be added. Create a method for adding the values into the studentList
	//Method name should be add with a String parameter
	//Repeat the same for remove method
	//It would return the studentList
