//Import the Map, HashMap, LinkedHashMAp, TreeMap packages

//Create a public class named StudentBasicDetail
	
	//Create private string variables named id and name
	
	//Create Map variables named hash, linkedhash and tree with their corresponding constuctors
	
	//Include appropriate getters and setters
	
	//Create a method named add of Map return type with two string parameters (id and name)
	
		//Put the values into hashMap, linkedHashMap, treeMap
		
		//return the hash

	
	//Create a method named clear with Map return type with two string parameters (id and name)

		//Clear all the values, using clear method (hash.clear() --> would clear the content in hash map)
		
		//return hash
		
	
	//Create an HashMap method with one parameter of type Map with the method's return type being Object 
	
		//Create key and value as String variables and assign them as null

		//Use enhanced for loop for assigning the key and value pair
		//Use map.entrySet() for iteration
  
			//Use getKey and getValue method to get the key and value 
			
			//Print the key and value to check for existence
			
		//return the hash
		
	
	//Repeat the same procedure for LinkedHashMap and TreeMap and return the corresponding values
